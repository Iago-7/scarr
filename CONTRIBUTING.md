# Contributing Process

* Patches should be submitted in the form of Pull Requests to the SCARR repository on GitHub.
* For bugs and feature Requests, please open an [issue](https://github.com/decryptofy/scarr/issues).
* Within the Python context, we do *not* consider GPL to be an appropriate license, run [liccheck](https://pypi.org/project/liccheck/) to make sure not to accidentally import GPL code.
* For newly added Python source code files, include the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (no copyleft exception) header.
* For newly included Python packages, run liccheck -s license_check.ini to make sure that only license-compatible projects are included (next step: include that as a GitHub action).
* New contributors that add/modify/extend source code files under the MPL 2.0 license should include themselves in the list of contributors in the README.md (i.e., the term contribution and contributor follow the MPL 2.0 license definitions).

# Licensing Explained

In the following, we would like to briefly explain SCARR's license as this might be an important aspect for future contributors. Since SCARR is licensed under the MPL-2.0-no-copyleft-exception (see FAQ [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/)), SCARR's code itself must be open-source. However, there are nuanced differences compared to GPL that we consider important.

Permissible:
* Larger works can include SCARR *without* revealing code outside of SCARR (unlike GPL)
* Add closed-source/classified extensions to SCARR, if desired, on a per-file basis (unlike LGPL)

Prohibited:
* Cannot include GPL code into SCARR, to make sure the above remains a free choice
* Cannot adopt from SCARR only by acknowledging its use (to prevent undue commercialization)

When working in the hardware security domain, projects can be of sensitive or classified nature. For us, it is perfectly fine for such scenarios to extend SCARR on a per-file basis and keep these additional files under proprietary/classified license, even when distributing SCARR and these extensions to other entities (e.g., from one organization or government entity to another). We consider this a greater freedom compared to imposing GPL rules onto everyone using/extending this project.

Note: the overwhelming majority of Python projects is licensed under MIT, BSD, or Apache 2.0 license that can be combined with SCARR. We are simply being explicit about not including GPL into SCARR, thereby simplifying the inbound=outbound model.
